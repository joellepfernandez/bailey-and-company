##Installation Instructions
Click [here](https://joellepfernandez.github.io/bailey-and-company/catch_em/index.html) to play the game.

##Approach Taken
This game was inspired by the class activity where we randomly generated boxes that had randomly generated locations. Similarly, this game randomly generates an index for images in an array and then randomly generates a location in the game.

##How to Play
1. Enter your name.
2. Press the 'Start' button to begin the game.
3. Click on as many items that are good for dogs.
4. Play again or have another player play.
5. Click 'Find Winner' to see who had the top score and won the game.
6. Restart the game by click on the 'Restart' button.
